###Introduction

This is a sample project created in response to a [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18220117/ios-parse-multiple-xml-files-for-each-tableview-row/18222471#18222471).  

This sample app simply takes an array of Yahoo weather WOEID's and for each row it retrieves and parses the XML asynchronously using `NSOperation` subclass, `CityOperation`.

Please refer to that Stack Overflow post for more information.
